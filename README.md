# Insertion-sort
Implementing the insertion sort algorithm

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
Algorithm
// Sort an arr[] of size n
insertionSort(arr, n)
Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
……a) Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0…i-1]
